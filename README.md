# Bigus app

This app is designed for construction companies to manage project data. You can add, edit, and delete projects, as well as register and login.

It's built with React for the frontend and a simple Node.js database. To use it, set up a .env file with the PORT variable for the server port and ensure you have a db.json file configured. The db.json file serves as the database.

Once configured, simply run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.
